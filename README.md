# 💰 FinSight – Clarify Your Spending, Fortify Your Savings

> A transparent, AI-assisted financial awareness platform designed to help young Indians understand, measure, and improve their financial health.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

A significant portion of household income in India is spent on EMIs, necessities, and discretionary lifestyle expenses, leading to reduced savings and increasing financial vulnerability.

Key concerns:
- High EMI burden
- Shrinking household savings
- Rising personal loans
- Impulse and lifestyle-driven spending
- Lack of structured financial awareness

FinWise aims to bridge the gap between income and financial discipline through explainable scoring and actionable insights.

## 🎯 Our Solution

FinWise is a personal finance awareness platform that helps users:

- Track expenses manually
- Set category-wise budgets
- Compute a **Finance Health Score (0–100)**
- Get AI-based awareness recommendations
- Plan emergency funds
- Simulate SIP & SWP projections
- Understand financial risk exposure

Unlike investment apps, FinWise focuses on **awareness, transparency, and responsible financial behavior** — not transactional investing.
